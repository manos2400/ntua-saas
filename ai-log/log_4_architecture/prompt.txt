User
i want you to give me a basic microservice architecture for an application that a user can upload problems with its metadata and parameters and then the application runs this problems with its solvers and show the solutions , also the user can see analytics about his/hers problems and a list of them.

Sure! Designing a microservice architecture for an application where users can upload problems with metadata and parameters, run solvers on these problems, and view solutions and analytics involves several key components. Here's a basic microservice architecture outline:

1. User Management Service
Responsibilities: Handle user authentication and authorization, manage user profiles.
Endpoints:
POST /register: Register a new user.
POST /login: Authenticate a user.
GET /profile: Get user profile details.
PUT /profile: Update user profile details.
2. Problem Management Service
Responsibilities: Allow users to upload problems, manage metadata and parameters.
Endpoints:
POST /problems: Upload a new problem with metadata and parameters.
GET /problems: Retrieve a list of problems for the authenticated user.
GET /problems/{id}: Retrieve details of a specific problem.
PUT /problems/{id}: Update an existing problem.
DELETE /problems/{id}: Delete a problem.
3. Solver Service
Responsibilities: Run solvers on uploaded problems, store and manage solutions.
Endpoints:
POST /solvers/run: Trigger a solver to run on a specific problem.
GET /solvers/status/{id}: Check the status of a running solver.
GET /solvers/results/{id}: Retrieve the results of a solved problem.
4. Analytics Service
Responsibilities: Provide analytics on user problems, such as usage statistics and performance metrics.
Endpoints:
GET /analytics/summary: Get a summary of analytics for the user.
GET /analytics/problem/{id}: Get analytics for a specific problem.
5. Notification Service
Responsibilities: Send notifications to users about the status of their problems and solutions.
Endpoints:
POST /notifications/send: Send a notification to a user.
GET /notifications: Retrieve notifications for the authenticated user.
6. Frontend Service
Responsibilities: Serve the web application interface where users interact with the system.
Endpoints:
Static files serving for the web UI.
API gateway or reverse proxy to route frontend requests to appropriate backend services.
7. Database Service
Responsibilities: Store all data related to users, problems, solutions, and analytics.
Components:
User Database: Stores user credentials and profiles.
Problem Database: Stores problem metadata and parameters.
Solution Database: Stores results from solvers.
Analytics Database: Stores analytics data for users and problems.
Example Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js or Angular for the web application.
Backend: Node.js with Express for microservices, or a combination of Spring Boot (Java) for some services.
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
Message Queue: RabbitMQ or Kafka for inter-service communication (especially between Problem Management, Solver, and Notification services).
Containerization: Docker for packaging services.
Orchestration: Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.
Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and analytics.
Interaction Flow
User Registration and Login:

User registers and logs into the system using the User Management Service.
Uploading Problems:

User uploads problems via the Problem Management Service, specifying metadata and parameters.
Running Solvers:

User triggers solvers on specific problems via the Solver Service.
Solver Service processes the problem and stores the result.
Viewing Solutions:

User retrieves the solutions from the Solver Service.
Analytics and Monitoring:

User views analytics related to their problems via the Analytics Service.
Notifications:

Notification Service sends updates on the status of problems and solutions to the user.
This architecture ensures that each component is decoupled and can scale independently, adhering to the principles of microservice architecture.
